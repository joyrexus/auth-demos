Quick demo of [HTTP Basic Auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) with [`hapi-auth-basic`](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi-auth-basic) plugin.

In this demo we're [validating](https://github.com/joyrexus/auth-demos/blob/gh-pages/basic-auth/hapi-ldap-tls/server.js#L18) the returned credentials provided by the user (viz., username and password) [against an LDAP server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol#Bind_.28authenticate.29) (`ldap.uchicago.edu`).


## Usage

    npm install
    npm run start

Once the server is running try opening the login route ([`https://localhost:8080/login`](https://localhost:8080/login)) in a web browser.

You should get prompted for a username and password.  If you have a [CNet ID](https://itservices.uchicago.edu/services/cnetid), you should get authenticated and receive a welcome message.

Instead of using a web browser, you can alternatively test your credentials with our command-line client:

    node client.js --username CNET_ID --password CNET_PASS

If authenticated, should return ...

    'Welcome <CNET_ID>!'
